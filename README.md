This game was created to practice and demonstrate several key JavaScript concepts:
* Class interaction and communication between different modules
* DOM manipulation and event handling
* Audio implementation and management
* Timer and interval controls
* State management in a game context

Game Rules:
* Hit the mole each time it appears
* Each hit gives you 50 points

* Every 10 seconds, the speed will change
* If you miss 10 moles, you lose the game!
* You can pause the game at any time
